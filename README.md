Converting Toronto demographic data from toronto.ca to Hive tables, via R

Data downloaded from toronto.ca in csv format

"The Census of Population is held across Canada every 5 years and collects data about age and sex, families and households, language, immigration and internal migration, ethnocultural diversity, Aboriginal peoples, housing, education, income, and labour.  City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles use this Census data to provide a portrait of the demographic, social and economic characteristics of the people and households in each City of Toronto neighbourhood. The profiles present selected highlights from the data, but these accompanying data files provide the full data set assembled for each neighbourhood."

Original csv from toronto.ca was explored, cleaned and restructured in Excel and R such that it can be loaded to Hive as seamlessly as possible. A comprehensive walkthrough is at https://datacritics.com/2018/04/10/rolling-up-the-sleeves-on-my-first-data-project/.
